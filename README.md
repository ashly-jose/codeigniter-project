# codeigniter-project
This project is a lottery result platform developed using CodeIgniter, designed to display real-time lottery results every 15 minutes. The system automatically updates the results, ensuring that users always have access to the latest information without delay. Additionally, it offers the option to view past results from previous days, providing users with easy access to historical data. 

The platform is built with user experience in mind, offering a simple and intuitive interface to navigate through current and past results. Administrators also have control over the website, with an option to shut it down when necessary, such as for maintenance or updates. This feature ensures smooth management of the platform.

With its combination of real-time updates, historical data retrieval, and administrative control, the project provides a reliable and efficient solution for managing and displaying lottery results, all while offering flexibility for both users and administrators.
